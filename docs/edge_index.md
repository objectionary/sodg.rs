# Edge index design note

## Overview

Outbound edges on a vertex are exposed through `Sodg::kids`, which must remain
fast for both sparse and dense vertices. The `EdgeIndex` helps by providing an
adaptive mapping from interned label identifiers to destination vertex ids.

## Rationale

* **Small graph bias:** Most vertices in EO programs have a handful of outbound
  edges. A fixed-capacity `micromap::Map` keeps those lookups allocation-free and
  iteration-friendly.
* **Seamless growth:** Vertices that grow beyond 32 distinct labels transparently
  promote the index to a standard `HashMap`. This keeps lookup complexity at
  `O(1)` without imposing hash-table costs on the common, tiny case.
* **Label interning:** Storing `LabelId` instead of `Label` drastically reduces
  the size of the keys inside the index, improving cache locality for traversal
  heavy workloads.

## Trade-offs

* **Promotion cost:** The first insertion beyond the small-map threshold walks
  the entire map to populate the `HashMap`. Benchmarks show this one-time cost is
  more than offset by faster lookups in the dense regime.
* **Growth-aware promotion:** Promotion allocates the destination `HashMap`
  using a doubling growth factor and eagerly reserves for the next expansion to
  smoothen allocations across the 30â€“40 degree window. Callers should expect the
  amortized cost of inserts to stay nearly flat after the first promotion.
* **Two sources of truth:** The vertex keeps the `Vec<Edge>` as the canonical
  record while the index mirrors it. Tests assert that rebuilds and removals keep
  the two data structures synchronized.
* **Identifier limits:** `LabelId` and encoded vertex identifiers are `u32` to
  keep the index compact. Consumers must ensure the graph size stays within the
  representable range.

## Maintenance tips

* When changing the promotion threshold, update both `SMALL_THRESHOLD` and the
  benchmark scenarios in `benches/bench.rs` to keep performance coverage honest.
* Any new mutation on `Vertex` must update the index alongside the edge list;
  add regression tests whenever you introduce a new code path.
* The label interner guarantees that equal labels share an identifier. If the
  interner changes, revisit the debug assertions in the iterator implementation
  to keep the mirror intact.
